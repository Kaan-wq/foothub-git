The code is still in an infinite re-render/infinite loop, and that will heat up your CPU.
To stop that, open Developer Tools and Reload ASAP. Then the code will pause. Check the Call Stack!
Look for useEffect() with no second parameter, or for state changes during render, since that triggers re-render.
